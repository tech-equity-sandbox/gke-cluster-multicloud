## Getting started

Depending on the platform setup, the asset may initialize automatically or may need to be manually executed. To manually execute the asset, run the command `./gke-cluster-multicloud.sh` on the terminal.

When you run the script, it sets up the pre-requisite automation tools behind the scenes. 

Please be patient, and allow a few seconds for the lab to initialize. 

You will be prompted to enter any key to continue once the initialization process is complete.

If the step by step guide is not displayed automatically, enter `G` below the `What additional steps do you want to perform...` prompt.

There are 3 modes of operation. 

Set the mode of operation by selecting option `0` on the menu, and enter your preference from the list below:

- `y` to preview configuration or commands.
- `n` to execute commands in the create mode.
- `d` to delete resources in the delete mode.

Click the **START** button below to continue to the next page.

## Selecting a project

You need to select a project for this lab.

*Hint: You should be the Owner or Editor of this project. We recommend deleting the project at the end of the lab or using the `d` option to delete provisioned resources and avoid incurring additional costs.*

Set the create mode by selecting `0` at the menu, and enter `n` at the prompt.

Click the **NEXT** button to continue.

## Sign in

You need to authenticate to `gcloud` to complete the lab.

Click the link displayed, sign-in using your Google Cloud account, and click the `Allow` button to grant permissions to Google Cloud SDK. 

Click the `Copy` button to copy the authorization code. 

Return to the cloud shell terminal and paste the authorization code into the prompt to authenticate to cloud shell.

Enter a valid Google Cloud project ID at the prompt to confirm the project you intend to use. You must have project owner or editor role privileges on this project.

Enter any key at the `$` prompt to return to the menu, and click the **NEXT** button to continue.

Note the comments describing each command.

Explore content of the repository on the filesystem.

To enable APIs, click the **NEXT** button.

Enter any key at the `$` prompt in the cloud shell terminal.

## Step 2: Enable APIs

You need to enable the APIs in the project to perform the required tasks. 

You only need to do this once for your project. 

Enter `2` at the `additional steps to perform` prompt to enable the API.  

Note the list of APIs enabled.

To create Kubernetes cluster, click the **NEXT** button.

Enter any key at the `$` prompt in the cloud shell terminal.

## Step 3 Configure GKE cluster

Enter `3` at the `additional steps to perform` prompt to configure GKE cluster. 

Note the comments describing each command, and the cluster configuration parameters.

The command has been simplified and includes only non-default values.

Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview?project={{project-id}} to explore the Kubernetes cluster on the console.

To prepare AWS networking resources for GKE cluster configuration, click the **NEXT** button.

Enter any key at the `$` prompt in the cloud shell terminal.

## Step 4: Prepare AWS networking resources for GKE cluster configuration
